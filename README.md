<h1>Destructuring and Spread Operator</h1>

<p>Array destructuring allows us to assign every value in an array to its variable. Since the introduction of the spread operator, it's quite simple to split up an array into values that are relevant for the user. Let's give an example of array destructuring: var numbers = [1,6,9,8,2];</p>

<p>Object destructuring is a useful JavaScript feature to extract properties from objects and bind them to variables. Even better, object destructuring can extract multiple properties in a single statement, can access properties from nested objects, and can set a default value if the property doesn't exist.</p>

<p>The JavaScript spread operator ( ... ) allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object.
